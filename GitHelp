// *** Git in a nutshell *** \\
   Trying to download the repo:
$ git clone name_of_repo

   When you update code and want to push it to the
      repository:
$ git status //lets you see the changes you have made     
$ git pull
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'your commit message'
$ git push
*** note *** This will push directly to the master
branch. If there are merge conflicts in the code, you
will have to resolve them. Ask Courtney if confused
